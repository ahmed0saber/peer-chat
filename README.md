# PeerChat: Browser-Based P2P Messaging

PeerChat is a lightweight, browser-based peer-to-peer messaging application
built with PeerJS. This application allows users to establish direct connections
and chat with each other without requiring a central server to relay messages.

## Features

- Real-time messaging between peers with direct P2P connections
- Auto-generated unique peer IDs for simple connection setup
- Modern WhatsApp-inspired chat interface
- Connection status indicators and notifications
- Mobile-responsive design for use on any device
- No message storage - conversations remain private between peers

Perfect for quick, secure conversations or as a foundation for more complex P2P
applications. Simply share your ID, connect with a peer, and start chatting
instantly.
